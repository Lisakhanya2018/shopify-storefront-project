# Copilot Instructions for Nova-wear Website

## Project Overview
This codebase is a static website project. The current structure includes a `css/style.css` file for styling. The main architecture is simple, with all styles centralized in the CSS file. There are no build tools, frameworks, or external dependencies detected at this time.

## Key Directories and Files
- `css/style.css`: Main stylesheet for the website. All visual styles should be added or updated here.
- No README or other documentation files currently exist.
- No build scripts, test suites, or automation tools are present.

## Developer Workflows
- **Editing Styles**: Directly modify `css/style.css` for all style changes. Follow standard CSS conventions.
- **Adding Pages/Assets**: Place new HTML files or assets (images, fonts) in the root or create new folders as needed. Reference assets in CSS using relative paths.
- **No Build Step**: Changes are reflected immediately; no compilation or bundling is required.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Keep CSS organized by grouping related styles and using comments for section headers.
- Use descriptive class and ID names that reflect their purpose in the UI.
- Avoid inline styles in HTML; centralize all styling in `css/style.css`.

## Integration Points
- No external libraries or frameworks are currently integrated.
- If adding new dependencies, document them in a new README.md file and update this instruction file.

## Example Pattern
```css
/* Header styles */
.header {
  background-color: #fff;
  /* ...other styles... */
}
```

## Next Steps
- If you add new major components, workflows, or dependencies, update this file to reflect those changes.
- For more complex workflows, consider adding a README.md with build/test instructions.
